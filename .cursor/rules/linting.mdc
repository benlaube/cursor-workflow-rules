# Linting Rule

## Metadata
- **Created:** 2025-12-02
- **Last Updated:** 2025-12-02
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Description:** Auto-applied rule that guides AI agent behavior around linting to maintain code quality without being noisy or disruptive.

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies automatically to all code changes and development work. It guides AI agent behavior to ensure linting is handled appropriately throughout the development lifecycle.

---

## 1. When to Run Linting

### 1.1 Before Implementing Big Changes

- As part of `pre-flight-check`, run a light lint or at least:
  - Confirm there are no glaring lint errors on the main branch or current base
- See: `.cursor/commands/pre-flight-check.md` Section 3.3

### 1.2 While Coding

- Fix lint issues in the files you touch
- Run lint incrementally (per file or per change) to catch issues early
- Use auto-fix capabilities when available

### 1.3 Before PR

- Run full lint against the relevant scope (project/app, not just a single file)
- Fix all errors; do not leave "I'll fix ESLint later" unless explicitly allowed by the user
- See: `.cursor/commands/pr-review-check.md` Section 1.1

---

## 2. How to Fix Lint Issues

### 2.1 Auto-Fix When Possible

- Prefer auto-format commands over hand-formatting:
  - `npm run lint -- --fix` (ESLint)
  - `prettier --write .` (Prettier)
  - `python -m ruff . --fix` (Ruff)
  - `black .` (Black)

### 2.2 Fix in Files You Touch

- Fix lint issues in the files you modify
- Do **not** start large lint-only refactors unless explicitly asked
- If asked to "fix all ESLint issues in repo", then proceed with full refactor

### 2.3 Report Status Once

- Don't repeatedly promise "let me fix those ESLint errors…" in chat
- Instead, quietly:
  - Run the linter
  - Fix violations in your edits
  - Report the final lint status once per major change

---

## 3. Don't Fight the Config

### 3.1 Respect Existing Configs

- Use the existing ESLint/Ruff/Prettier rules as the source of truth
- The AI agent MUST respect existing linter configs in the repo
- MUST NOT silently change them without an explicit task to do so

### 3.2 Proposing Config Changes

- If the user asks to change lint rules, propose minimal, rational changes
- Update the config + docs together when making changes
- Explain the rationale for any proposed changes

---

## 4. Integration with Commands

### 4.1 Pre-Flight Check

- Light lint pass is part of pre-flight validation
- See: `.cursor/commands/pre-flight-check.md`
- Reference: `standards/process/linting.md` Section 6.1

### 4.2 PR Review Check

- Full lint pass is required before PR submission
- See: `.cursor/commands/pr-review-check.md`
- Reference: `standards/process/linting.md` Section 6.2

### 4.3 Standalone Lint Check

- Use `lint-check` command for independent lint validation
- See: `.cursor/commands/lint-check.md`

---

## 5. What "Passing" Means

### 5.1 No Errors

- All linter invocations must exit with code 0
- No "error"-level issues are tolerated

### 5.2 Warnings Policy

- Warnings are **not** ignored by default
- Projects may choose:
  - **Strict:** Warnings treated as errors (recommended for new/AI-heavy code)
  - **Relaxed:** Warnings allowed but must not grow
- New code should not introduce additional warnings

### 5.3 Formatting

- Use auto-formatters where configured
- Prefer auto-format commands over hand-formatting
