# Cursor Rule Creation & Maintenance Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Creating a new file in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Modifying any existing `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file
- Any Cursor rule file is opened for editing

---

## Core Principle

**Cursor rules must be well-structured, consistently formatted, and properly documented.** This rule enforces the standards defined in `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md`.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** The standard is the Single Source of Truth. **Always read `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md`** to get the latest definitions, valid types, and templates before creating or modifying rules.

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Before Creating a New Rule

**1. Read the Standard:**
   - Read `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` to understand rule types and naming conventions.

**2. Validation Checks:**
   - **Rule vs Command:** Ensure behavior applies automatically (Rule) vs user-invoked (Command).
   - **Duplication:** Search `.cursor/rules/` to avoid duplicates.
   - **Nested Rules:** Determine if this should be a nested rule (domain-specific) located in a subdirectory. (See Standard Section 15)
   - **Length:** Target 100-300 lines. Split if larger.

**3. Determine Rule Type:**
   - Select one of the 8 standard rule types defined in `cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 4.

### 2. While Creating/Modifying a Rule

**MANDATORY:** Use the templates defined in `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 3.

**Quick Reference - YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does and when to apply it (1-2 sentences)
version: X.Y.Z (semantic versioning)
created: MM-DD-YYYY (creation date)
lastUpdated: MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS EST (date and time in EST timezone)
alwaysApply: true/false (whether rule applies to all files or just matching globs)
globs: file/pattern (REQUIRED - use empty string "" if alwaysApply is true, NO quotes)
type: Rule Type - Brief description (Must match standard types)
applicability: When/where this rule applies
dependencies: [file1.md, file2.md] (optional - list of dependencies)
relatedCommands: [command1.md] (optional)
relatedRules: [rule1.mdc] (optional)
relatedStandards: [standard1.md] (optional)
---
```

**Quick Reference - Content Structure:**
1. **When This Rule Applies:** Clear trigger conditions.
2. **Core Principle:** High-level purpose.
3. **Agent Responsibilities:** Detailed actionable guidance.
4. **Examples:** Optional.
5. **Related Files:** Cross-references.
6. **How to Use:** Summary instructions.

**Refer to `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 3 for detailed field definitions and validation rules.**

### 3. Creating Nested Rules (Domain-Specific "Roles")

**When:** For domain-specific guidance (frontend, backend, etc.) that applies to specific subdirectories.

**Instructions:**
1. Follow **Nested Rules Strategy** in `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 15.
2. Use the Nested Rule Template from Section 15.6 of the standard.
3. Keep concise (50-150 lines).

### 4. After Creating/Modifying a Rule

**MANDATORY STEPS:**

#### Step 4.1: Validate Rule Structure
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid and complete (Check against Standard Section 3.1)
- [ ] `description` explains WHAT and WHEN
- [ ] `globs` is present and accurate
- [ ] `type` is one of the 8 standard types
- [ ] All required content sections are present

#### Step 4.2: Update Dependencies
- [ ] Update `relatedCommands`, `relatedRules`, `relatedStandards`
- [ ] Check reverse dependencies (files referencing this rule)

#### Step 4.3: Update Related Documentation
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with entry and timestamp
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` (if workflow affected)
- [ ] Update Integration Guides (if applicable)

#### Step 4.4: Test
- [ ] Verify rule triggers correctly based on `globs`

---

## Version Management

**Always update both:**
- `version:` field in YAML frontmatter
- `lastUpdated:` field in YAML frontmatter

**Versioning Rules:** See `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 6.

---

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- **`documentation-dependency-tracking.mdc`**: Tracks dependencies when documentation is modified.
- **`version-management.mdc`**: Defines version numbering standards for all documentation.
- **`runtime-configuration.mdc`**: Defines runtime environment and configuration standards.
- **`audit-documentation-rules-metadata.md`**: Validates metadata completeness.

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files).**

**Agents should:**
1. **READ THE STANDARD FIRST:** `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md`.
2. Verify YAML frontmatter against the standard.
3. Use standard templates for content.
4. Update version and timestamps on every change.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Metadata matches Standard Section 3.1
- [ ] Content matches Standard Section 3.2
- [ ] Type matches Standard Section 4
- [ ] Versioning matches Standard Section 6
