# Project Rule: Notion Project Binding v2.0.0

For this project:
- **Notion Dev Project Name:** "Cursor Workflow Rules & Coding Standards"
- **Project ID/Page ID:** To be created (see instructions below)
- **Repository Path:** `/Users/benlaube/apps/Cursor - Workflow Rules : Coding Standards`
- **Repo Folder:** `Cursor - Workflow Rules : Coding Standards`
- **Database ID:** `ef116537-3e85-4145-a4c6-0cd39d44ff73` (Projects database)

## Notion Project Details

**Project Properties:**
- **Name:** Cursor Workflow Rules & Coding Standards
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Category:** Dev Project
- **Priority:** P1
- **Development Platform:** Cursor
- **Purpose:** Centralized repository of AI agent rules, coding standards, checklists, and reusable modules for consistent development across all projects.
- **Why this matters:** Ensures consistency, security, and efficiency across all development projects by providing standardized rules and reusable components.
- **Description:** This repository serves as the single source of truth for AI agent configurations, coding standards, development checklists, and reusable code modules used across all projects.

## Manual Creation Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** The Notion project page needs to be created manually in Notion:

1. Open Notion and navigate to the "Projects" database (📁 icon)
2. Click "New" to create a new project entry
3. Fill in the properties as specified above
4. Once created, update this file with the Project ID/Page ID

## Integration Behavior

When performing non-trivial work on this repository (new features, refactors, config changes, cleanup tasks), you should:

1. **Sync Metadata:** Use the semantics of `notion-sync-project-metadata` command to sync project status and metadata with the Notion "Projects" database.

2. **Check Open Tasks:** Query the Notion "Dev Tasks" database for open tasks linked to this project using the project relation.

3. **Update Task Status:** When you complete or significantly progress a task:
   - Update its Status in Notion (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Done")
   - Leave a short note referencing the relevant commit/PR/file
   - Add completion date if applicable

4. **Create New Tasks:** When discovering:
   - Bugs that can't be fixed immediately
   - Technical debt items
   - Future enhancements
   - Incomplete work that must be paused
   
   Create tasks in the Notion "Dev Tasks" database with:
   - Link to this project
   - Clear description
   - Priority level
   - Status: "Backlog" or "To Do"

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** modify or close tasks clearly owned by humans without leaving context
- **DO NOT** update task status without adding a comment about what was done
- **ALWAYS** link tasks to this project using the Project relation field
- **REFERENCE** specific files, commits, or PRs when updating tasks

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when performing non-trivial work on the Cursor Workflow Rules repository.**

**Agents should:**
- Sync project metadata to Notion using `notion-sync-project-metadata` semantics when significant changes occur
- Check Notion "Dev Tasks" database for open tasks linked to this project before starting work
- Update task status in Notion when completing or progressing tasks (with commit/PR references)
- Create new tasks in Notion "Dev Tasks" database when discovering bugs, technical debt, or incomplete work
- Link all tasks to this project using the Project relation field
- Never modify human-owned tasks without leaving context
- Always add comments when updating task status

**Integration points:**
- Triggered during task workflow (see `task-workflow.mdc`)
- Referenced in AI interaction rules (see `ai-interaction-rules.mdc`)
- Uses Notion MCP for database operations
