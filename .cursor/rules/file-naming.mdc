# File Naming Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Creating new files anywhere in the repository
- Renaming existing files
- Validating file names during development

---

## Core Principle

**All files must follow consistent naming conventions based on their type, language, and location.** This ensures predictability, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

**Source Standards:**
- `standards/project-planning/project-structure.md` Section 5 - General naming conventions
- `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 5 - Rule naming conventions

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Directory Naming
**Format:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-auth`, `data-processing`)
- **Exception:** Follow framework conventions (Next.js `app/`, React `components/`)

### 2. Code File Naming

**TypeScript/JavaScript:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-service.ts`, `api-client.ts`)
- **Exception:** React components use `PascalCase` (e.g., `LoginForm.tsx`)

**Python:** `snake_case` (e.g., `user_service.py`, `api_client.py`)

**Test Files:** Match source naming + test suffix
- TS/JS: `user-service.test.ts` or `SubmitButton.test.tsx`
- Python: `test_user_service.py` or `user_service_test.py`

### 3. Cursor Rules and Commands

**Rules:** `kebab-case.mdc` (e.g., `file-naming.mdc`, `task-workflow.mdc`)
**Commands:** `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `pre-flight-check.md`, `project-audit.md`)

### 4. Configuration and Module Files

**Standard Config:** Follow tool/framework conventions (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.env.example`)
**Custom Config:** `kebab-case` (e.g., `app-config.json`, `database-config.yml`)
**Modules:** Directory `kebab-case`, files follow language conventions

### 5. Special Cases

- **Framework Requirements:** Follow framework conventions when they conflict (Next.js, React)
- **Legacy Files:** Don't rename without explicit instruction; follow conventions for new files
- **Generated Files:** Follow tool conventions (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`)

---

## Examples

### Good Examples
- TypeScript service: `src/services/user-auth-service.ts`
- React component: `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
- Python module: `src/data_processing.py`
- Cursor rule: `.cursor/rules/database-operations.mdc`

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Using `camelCase` or `PascalCase` for TS/JS files (except React components)
- ❌ Using `kebab-case` for Python files
- ❌ Using `kebab-case` for React components
- ❌ Using `snake_case` for Cursor rules/commands
- ❌ Not following framework conventions when they conflict

**For comprehensive examples and patterns, see the source standards referenced above.**

## Validation Checklist

**Code Files:**
- [ ] TS/JS: `kebab-case` (except React: `PascalCase`)
- [ ] Python: `snake_case`
- [ ] Test files: Match source naming + test suffix

**Cursor Files:**
- [ ] Rules: `kebab-case.mdc`
- [ ] Commands: `kebab-case.md`

**Directories:**
- [ ] All directories: `kebab-case` (except framework requirements)

---

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:
- **`cursor-rule-creation.mdc`** - Rules must follow `kebab-case.mdc` naming
- **`cursor-command-creation.mdc`** - Commands must follow `kebab-case.md` naming
- **`standards/project-planning/project-structure.md`** - Implements directory/file naming (Section 5)

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying files throughout the repository.**

**Agents should:**
1. Use `kebab-case` for directories and TS/JS files (except React components: `PascalCase`)
2. Use `snake_case` for Python files
3. Use `kebab-case` for Cursor rules (`.mdc`) and commands (`.md`)
4. Follow framework conventions when they conflict with general rules
5. Verify naming before creating files

**Quick reference:**
- **Directories:** `kebab-case`
- **TS/JS:** `kebab-case` (React: `PascalCase`)
- **Python:** `snake_case`
- **Rules:** `kebab-case.mdc`
- **Commands:** `kebab-case.md`
