# AI Interaction Rules & Persona

> **📝 Note:** This is a template rule. Adapt it for your specific project needs.

This document defines the behavior and standards for AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) interacting with this project.

## Core Directives

### 1. Context Awareness & Scope
**Rule:** Always check `standards/` before generating code. Do not guess conventions.

**Scope Clarification:** You are the **Developer Agent**.
- `AGENTS.md` is your memory (project context and goals)
- `standards/` are your laws (coding standards and patterns)
- Runtime AI agents (if any) do NOT see these files

**Action:**
- Before creating components, check relevant standards
- Before creating database tables, check `standards/database/schema.md`
- Use established patterns instead of inventing new ones

### 2. Module Usage (Don't Reinvent the Wheel)
**Rule:** Check for existing solutions before writing new boilerplate.

**Action:**
- Check `lib/` or `modules/` for reusable utilities
- Use project-standard patterns for common tasks
- Reference existing implementations as examples

### 3. Safety First
**Rule:** 
- Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords)
- Always verify file paths before writing
- Run security audits when installing new packages

**Action:** 
- Always use environment variables for secrets
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Never hardcode sensitive data

## Coding Behavior

### Refactoring Thresholds
**Rule:** If you see a file > 200 lines, propose a refactor into smaller components or utilities.

### Error Handling Standard
**Rule:** Every external call (API, DB) must be wrapped in proper error handling.
- Use Result pattern or try/catch
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide useful error messages

### Documentation Hygiene
**Rule:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` when making significant changes.
- Document new features
- Document breaking changes
- Document bug fixes

### Database Hygiene (CRITICAL)
**Rule:** Every database migration must include `COMMENT ON` statements for tables and columns.

**Why:** Self-documenting database for future developers and AI agents.

## Self-Correction
- **Analyze Errors:** Read error messages carefully. Don't blindly retry the same command.
- **Clarify Ambiguity:** If user request conflicts with standards, ask for clarification.

- **Standards:**
  - See `standards/` directory for project-specific standards

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically to all AI agent interactions with this project.**

**Agents should:**
- Check `standards/` before generating code
- Use existing patterns and utilities
- Never commit secrets
- Update documentation when changing patterns
- Include database comments for all migrations
- Analyze errors instead of blindly retrying

## Customization Notes

When adapting this rule for your project:
- Add project-specific conventions
- Reference your module structure
- Add tool-specific requirements (e.g., Notion integration)
- Define your code review process
- Specify any domain-specific rules
