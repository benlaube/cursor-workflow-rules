# Pre-Flight Check Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Starting a new task or feature
- Beginning significant code changes
- The agent detects this is the start of a work session

---

## Core Principle

**Never start coding in a broken environment.** Before making changes, the agent MUST validate:
1. Git status is clean and synced
2. Dependencies are installed
3. Environment is configured
4. Baseline tests and build pass

**Source Checklist:** `standards/process/checklists/pre_flight_checklist_v1_0.md`

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Git Status Validation

**Before starting work, verify git state:**

1. **Check Current Branch:**
   - Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - If on `main` or `master`: ⚠️ Warn about working on main branch
   - Suggest creating feature branch if needed

2. **Check Working Tree:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain`
   - If uncommitted changes exist: ⚠️ Warn about dirty working tree
   - If clean: ✅ Proceed

3. **Sync with Remote:**
   - Check if behind: `git fetch origin && git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count`
   - If behind: ⚠️ Warn about being out of sync
   - If up to date: ✅ Proceed

### 2. Environment Validation

**Verify environment is ready:**

1. **Dependencies Check:**
   - **Node.js:** Check if `node_modules` exists
     - If missing: Auto-run `npm install`
   - **Python:** Check if `.venv` exists
     - If missing: Auto-create and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - ✅ Dependencies installed

2. **Configuration Check:**
   - Verify `.env` exists (or `.env.local`)
   - If missing: Auto-copy from `.env.example`
   - Compare keys between `.env` and `.env.example`
   - Warn about missing keys
   - ✅ Configuration complete

3. **Secrets Validation:**
   - For Supabase: Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set
   - For other services: Check required API keys
   - ✅ Secrets configured

### 3. Baseline Integrity

**Verify codebase is healthy:**

1. **Tests:**
   - Run: `npm test` (or equivalent)
   - If tests fail: ❌ **ABORT** - Fix tests first
   - If pass: ✅ Proceed

2. **Build:**
   - Run: `npm run build` (or equivalent)
   - If build fails: ❌ **ABORT** - Fix build first
   - If succeeds: ✅ Proceed

3. **Linter:**
   - Run: `npm run lint`
   - If errors: ⚠️ Warn, consider auto-fixing
   - Auto-fix if possible: `npm run lint -- --fix`
   - See `standards/process/code-quality-linting-standards.md` Section 6.1

### 4. Task Understanding

**Before proceeding, verify:**

1. **Requirements Clear:**
   - Prompt if task is unclear: "Do you understand the goal?"
   - Suggest reviewing requirements if needed

2. **Documentation Review:**
   - Check `standards/` for relevant patterns
   - List applicable standards for the task

3. **Planning:**
   - Suggest creating TODO list for complex tasks

## Auto-Healing Actions

This rule will automatically:
- Install missing dependencies
- Create `.env` from `.env.example`
- Auto-fix linter errors (if fixable)
- Run these actions WITHOUT asking first (self-healing)

---

## Output Examples

### Success Case
```
✅ Pre-flight check complete – safe to start coding.

Summary:
- Git: Clean working tree, synced with origin/main
- Environment: Dependencies installed, .env configured
- Baseline: Tests pass, build succeeds, linter clean
- Task: Requirements clear, ready to proceed
```

### Failure Case
```
❌ Pre-flight check failed. Address these issues:

Issues:
- Git: Working tree has uncommitted changes
- Tests: 2 tests failing in auth.test.ts
- Linter: 5 errors in src/utils/helpers.ts

Cannot proceed until issues are resolved.
```

## Integration with Task Workflow

This rule integrates with `task-workflow.mdc`:
- Runs automatically at start of "Before Starting a Task" phase
- Prevents coding in broken environment
- Enables auto-healing for common issues

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when starting new work.**

**Agents should:**
1. Detect when starting new task or significant work
2. Run pre-flight validation checks automatically
3. Auto-heal common issues (dependencies, .env, linter)
4. ABORT if critical issues found (failing tests, broken build)
5. Warn about non-critical issues (dirty git, TODOs)
6. Only proceed when environment is validated

**Trigger conditions:**
- User asks to "start task", "begin feature", "implement X"
- Agent detects start of work session
- Before making first significant code change
