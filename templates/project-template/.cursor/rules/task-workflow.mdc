# Task Workflow Rule

> **📝 Note:** This is a template rule. Adapt it for your project's specific workflow.

## 1. Before Starting a Task (Pre-Flight)

Before writing code, the agent MUST:

1. **Understand the Task:**
   - Clarify requirements if unclear
   - Identify affected files and components
   - Plan approach

2. **Check Environment:**
   - Verify dependencies are installed
   - Ensure `.env` is configured
   - Check git status (clean working tree)

3. **Review Standards:**
   - Check `standards/` for relevant patterns
   - Review related code for consistency
   - Identify reusable utilities

---

## 2. During Development

1. **Atomic Changes:**
   - Make small, testable changes
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
   - Test as you go

2. **Follow Standards:**
   - Use established patterns
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Write tests for new features

3. **Document as You Go:**
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update relevant docs if needed
   - Keep CHANGELOG.md updated

---

## 3. After Completing a Task (Post-Flight)

Before marking complete:

1. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Run tests (`npm test` or equivalent)
   - Test manually if applicable
   - Verify no regressions

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Run linter and fix issues
   - Format code consistently
   - Remove debug code

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes
   - Update relevant docs
   - Add/update code comments

4. **Review:**
   - Self-review changes
   - Check for missed edge cases
   - Verify error handling

---

## 4. Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Format: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Use kebab-case: `feature/add-user-auth`

### Commit Messages
- Format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Example: `feat: add user authentication`

### Before Committing
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] No debug code
- [ ] Relevant docs updated

---

## 5. Documentation & Versioning

- **Update Docs:** When changing features or architecture
- **Update CHANGELOG:** For user-facing changes
- **Version Bump:** Follow semantic versioning

---

## Integration with Standards

This workflow integrates with:
- **Standards** in `standards/` directory
- **Nested Rules** for domain-specific guidance
- **Commands** (if your project has custom commands)

---

## Customization Notes

When adapting this workflow:
- Add your git branching strategy
- Define your commit message format
- Add project-specific pre-flight checks
- Define your PR/review process
- Add any CI/CD integration steps
- Customize for your team's workflow
