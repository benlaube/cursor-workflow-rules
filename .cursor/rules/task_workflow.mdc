# Task Workflow Rule

## 1. Before Starting a Task (Pre-Flight)

Before writing code, the agent MUST:
1.  **Check Structure:** specific to the project (see `standards/project-structure.md`).
2.  **Run Pre-Flight:** Read and follow `checklists/pre-flight-check.md`.
3.  **Verify Environment:** Ensure the app is launchable via `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc`.

## 2. During Development

1.  **Atomic Changes:** Make small, testable changes.
2.  **Self-Correction:** If a command fails, attempt to self-heal (see `self_healing.mdc`) before asking the user.
3.  **Tool Usage:** Use specialized tools (`read_file`, `grep`) over generic terminal commands.

## 3. After Completing a Task (Post-Flight)

Before confirming completion:
1.  **Run Review:** Read and follow `checklists/pr-review-check.md`.
2.  **Update Docs:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` and relevant `standards/` if architecture changed.
3.  **Verify Launch:** Run `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc` one last time to ensure no regression.

## 4. Documentation updates

- Always update `CHANGELOG.md` with a timestamp and summary.
- If you added a new feature, ensure it is documented in `standards/` or `docs/`.
