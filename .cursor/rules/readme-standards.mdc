# README Standards Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying any `README.md` file in the repository.

---

## Core Principle

**Every README.md file must be clear, complete, and follow a consistent structure appropriate to its purpose.** Different types of READMEs serve different audiences and purposes, but all must provide essential information for users to understand and use what they're reading about.

---

## README Types

There are four main types of README files, each with specific requirements:

### Type 1: Root README (Project Overview)
**Location:** `/README.md`  
**Purpose:** High-level project overview and quick start guide  
**Audience:** Developers discovering or integrating the project

### Type 2: Module README (Usage Guide)
**Location:** `modules/{module-name}/README.md`  
**Purpose:** How to use a specific module  
**Audience:** Developers integrating the module into their projects

### Type 3: Standards README (Navigation Guide)
**Location:** `standards/README.md` or `standards/{category}/README.md`  
**Purpose:** Overview and navigation for standards  
**Audience:** Developers and AI agents seeking standards

### Type 4: Feature/Tool README (Documentation)
**Location:** Various (e.g., `docs/{feature}/README.md`, `tools/{tool}/README.md`)  
**Purpose:** Documentation for specific features or tools  
**Audience:** Users of the feature or tool

---

## Required Structure by Type

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Be Clear and Concise**
   - Use short, direct sentences
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary (define it if used)
   - Write for someone discovering the project/module for the first time

2. **Use Examples**
   - Provide concrete code examples
   - Comment examples to explain what's happening
   - Show both basic and advanced usage

3. **Be Practical**
   - Focus on "how to use" not "how it was built"
   - Include copy-pasteable commands
   - Provide actual file paths and concrete instructions

4. **Use Emojis Sparingly**
   - Root README: Use emojis for major sections (📚, 🗂️, 🚀, 🤖)
   - Module README: Use checkmarks (✅) for features
   - Standards README: Generally avoid emojis
   - Feature README: Optional, use for clarity

### Code Examples

1. **Always Include:**
   - Import statements
   - Comments explaining what's happening
   - Expected output or behavior

2. **Use TypeScript When Possible:**
   - Include type annotations
   - Show interface definitions
   - Demonstrate type safety

3. **Show Complete Examples:**
   - Don't use `...` or `// more code` unless absolutely necessary
   - Provide runnable examples when possible

### Links and Cross-References

1. **Use Relative Paths:**
   - `[Module README](./modules/module-name/README.md)`
   - `[Standard](./standards/standard-name.md)`

2. **Provide Context:**
   - Don't just link - explain why the link is relevant
   - Example: "See `standards/module-structure.md` for complete module organization patterns"

3. **Check Links:**
   - Verify all links work before committing
   - Update links when files are moved

---

## Metadata Requirements

### Root README
- ❌ No metadata section required (content speaks for itself)

### Module README
- ❌ No formal metadata section required
- ✅ But should include:
  - Dependencies with versions
  - Related documentation links
  - Installation instructions with concrete commands

### Standards README
- ✅ Full metadata section required (Status, Created, Last Updated, Version, Description)
- See `documentation-metadata.mdc` for complete requirements

### Feature/Tool README
- ⚪ Optional metadata section
- ✅ Should include version if versioned

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Vague
Bad: "This module helps with logging."  
Good: "Structured JSON logging with multi-dimensional categorization, context propagation, and multi-destination output (console, file, database)."

### ❌ Missing Installation Steps
Bad: "Install the dependencies and use it."  
Good: Provide exact `cp` and `npm install` commands.

### ❌ No Examples
Bad: "Use the `setupLogger` function to create a logger."  
Good: Show actual code with imports, configuration, and usage.

### ❌ Broken Links
Bad: Links that point to non-existent files  
Good: Verify all links work

### ❌ Assuming Knowledge
Bad: "Configure SSR as usual."  
Good: Link to SSR setup guide or explain the steps.

## Examples

### Good Module README Opening

```markdown
# Backend API Module

Standardized API handler wrapper for Next.js with Supabase SSR integration, automatic error handling, input validation, and standardized responses.

## Features

- ✅ **Supabase SSR Integration** - Automatic JWT handling via `@supabase/ssr`
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Zod schema validation for body and query params
- ✅ **Authentication** - Built-in auth middleware using Supabase
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Automatic try/catch with standardized error responses
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with inferred types

## Dependencies

- `@supabase/ssr` - Server-side Supabase client helpers
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client library
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `next` - Next.js framework
```

**Why it's good:**
- Clear description with key features
- Features use checkmarks and bold labels
- Dependencies listed with purposes

---

### Bad Module README Opening

```markdown
# My Module

This is a module for APIs.

## Install

Install it.

## Use

Use the function.
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Vague description
- No features list
- No dependencies
- No concrete installation instructions
- No usage examples

---

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:

### `documentation-metadata.mdc`
- That rule ensures metadata is complete for documentation files
- This rule defines README-specific structure
- Standards READMEs must follow both rules

### `module-structure.md`
- That standard defines required files in modules (including README.md)
- This rule defines what the README.md should contain

### `documentation-management.md`
- That standard defines overall documentation management
- This rule is specific to README files

---

## Related Files

- **Rules:**
  - [documentation-metadata.mdc](./documentation-metadata.mdc) - Ensures metadata completeness
- **Standards:**
  - [documentation-management.md](../../standards/project-planning/documentation-management.md) - Documentation management
  - [module-structure.md](../../standards/module-structure.md) - Module organization

---

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying README.md files.**

**Agents should:**

1. **Identify README type** (Root, Module, Standards, or Feature)
2. **Follow the appropriate structure** from Section 3
3. **Include all required sections** for that type
4. **Write clear, concrete content** (not vague descriptions)
5. **Provide runnable examples** with imports and comments
6. **Verify all links work** (use relative paths)
7. **Check validation checklist** before committing

**When creating a new README:**
- Copy the structure template for the appropriate type
- Fill in all required sections
- Add optional sections if they add value
- Provide concrete examples, not placeholders

**When updating an existing README:**
- Preserve existing structure unless improving it
- Add missing required sections
- Update examples to be clear and runnable
- Fix any broken links

---

## Notes

- READMEs are the first thing users see - make them count
- Write for someone discovering the project for the first time
- Provide copy-pasteable commands and examples
- Link to detailed docs, don't duplicate them
- Keep root READMEs high-level, module READMEs practical
