# Task Workflow Rule

## 1. Before Starting a Task (Pre-Flight)

Before writing code, the agent MUST:
1.  **Check Structure:** specific to the project (see `standards/project-structure.md`).
2.  **Run Pre-Flight:** Use `.cursor/commands/pre-flight-check.md` command or manually review `standards/development-checklists/pre-flight-checklist.md`.
3.  **Verify Environment:** Ensure the app is launchable via `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc`. If `start_app.sh` doesn't exist, run `create-start-scripts` command (`.cursor/commands/create-start-scripts.md`) to generate launch scripts.
4.  **Temporal Awareness:** For time-sensitive tasks, verify current date using `date` command (see `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc` Section 5).
5.  **Check Notion Tasks (If Project is Bound):** If a Notion Project Binding rule exists:
    - Query the Notion "Dev Tasks" database for open tasks linked to this project.
    - Review any high-priority or in-progress tasks that might be relevant to current work.
    - Consider whether the current task should be tracked in Notion.

## 2. During Development

1.  **Atomic Changes:** Make small, testable changes.
2.  **Self-Correction:** If a command fails, attempt to self-heal (see `.cursor/rules/auto-heal.mdc`) before asking the user.
3.  **Tool Usage:** Use specialized tools (`read_file`, `grep`) over generic terminal commands.
4.  **Function Documentation:** Every function must have comments with description and dependencies (per user rules).
5.  **Database Schema Requirements:** When creating/modifying database tables:
    - Ensure tables and fields have descriptions
    - Use descriptive names (not abbreviated)
    - Include `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
    - See user rules for complete requirements
6.  **Notion Task Creation (If Project is Bound):** If a Notion Project Binding rule exists:
    - When discovering bugs that can't be fixed immediately, create a task in Notion "Dev Tasks" database.
    - When work is incomplete and must be paused, create a task to track the remaining work.
    - When identifying future development items or technical debt, create tasks proactively.
    - Follow the guidelines in the Notion Task Creation rule (created by `.cursor/commands/notion-task-creation`).

## 3. After Completing a Task (Post-Flight)

Before confirming completion:
1.  **Run Review:** Use `.cursor/commands/pr-review-check.md` command or manually review `standards/development-checklists/pr-review-checklist.md`.
2.  **Update Docs:** 
    - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes (see `standards/documentation.md` Section 7 for format guidelines).
    - For database schema changes, update `CHANGELOG-DATABASE.md` with timestamped entries (per user rules).
    - Update relevant `standards/` if architecture changed.
    - Follow `.cursor/rules/workflow-standards-documentation-maintenance.mdc` for comprehensive documentation update requirements.
3.  **Verify Launch:** Run `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc` one last time to ensure no regression.
4.  **Launch & Debug Dev Server:** After completing a task or integration:
    - Launch the development server using `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc` so the user can see changes and test them. This should be done automatically unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
    - If errors occur during launch, use `launch-debug-fix` command (`.cursor/commands/launch-debug-fix.md` - if available) to iteratively debug and auto-heal errors until the dev environment is healthy.
    - The `launch-debug-fix` command integrates with `.cursor/rules/auto-heal.mdc` for automatic error recovery (port conflicts, missing dependencies, database connections, etc.).
5.  **Update Notion (If Project is Bound):** If a Notion Project Binding rule exists:
    - Update any related Notion tasks: Set status to "Done" and add a comment with commit hash/PR number.
    - Sync project metadata to Notion "Dev Projects" database if significant changes occurred (see `.cursor/commands/notion-sync-project-metadata`).
    - Create new tasks for any follow-up work or technical debt discovered during the task.

## 4. Periodic Maintenance & Audits

Before major releases, refactoring, or weekly/monthly for active projects, run periodic audits:

- **Project Audit:** Run `project-audit` command (`.cursor/commands/project-audit.md`) for full project structure validation.
- **Security Audit:** Run `security_audit` command (`.cursor/commands/audit-security.mdc`) for security vulnerabilities scan.
- **Full Health Check:** Run `full-project-health-check` meta-command to run all audits together.

**Checklists:**
- `standards/development-checklists/project-audit-checklist.md`
- `standards/security/security-audit-checklist.md`

**When to Run:**
- When onboarding a new repository
- Before major refactoring
- Before major releases
- Weekly/monthly for active projects

See `AGENTS.md` Section 6.5 for full lifecycle context.

## 5. Documentation & Versioning

- **Documentation Standards:** Follow `standards/documentation.md` for documentation management rules.
- **Documentation Maintenance:** Follow `.cursor/rules/workflow-standards-documentation-maintenance.mdc` for comprehensive documentation update requirements.
- **Changelogs:** 
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes (see `standards/documentation.md` Section 7 for format guidelines).
  - Update `CHANGELOG-DATABASE.md` for database schema changes (per user rules).
- **Versioning:** If editing a standard or documentation file, increment the version metadata at the top of the file (see `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc` for version numbering rules).
- **New Features:** If you added a new feature, ensure it is documented in `standards/` or `docs/`.
