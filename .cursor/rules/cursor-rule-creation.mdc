# Cursor Rule Creation & Maintenance Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule **automatically applies** when:
- Creating a new file in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Modifying any existing `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file
- Any Cursor rule file is opened for editing

---

## Core Principle

**Cursor rules must be well-structured, consistently formatted, and properly documented.** This rule ensures all Cursor rules follow the standards defined in `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md`.

---

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Before Creating a New Rule

**Verify this should be a rule, not a command:**
- ✅ Rule: Behavior applies automatically without user invocation
- ❌ Command: User needs to decide when to run it

**Check if similar rule exists:**
- Search `.cursor/rules/` for related rules
- Avoid duplicating existing rule functionality
- Consider extending existing rule instead of creating new one

**Determine rule type (from `cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 4):**
1. Auto-Applied Behavioral Rule
2. Environment/Configuration Rule
3. Workflow Integration Rule
4. Project-Specific Rule
5. Conditional Rule (File-Specific)
6. Error Recovery Rule
7. Security/Compliance Rule
8. Documentation Maintenance Rule

### 2. While Creating/Modifying a Rule

**MANDATORY: Include complete YAML frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
description: Brief one-sentence description of what this rule does
version: X.Y.Z (semantic versioning)
lastUpdated: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO date format)
globs: file/pattern (optional - omit if applies to all files, NO quotes)
alwaysApply: true/false (true = applies to all files, false = only matching globs)
type: Rule Type - Brief description (see cursor-rules-standards.md Section 4, NO quotes)
relatedCommands: [command1.md, command2.md] (optional - related cursor commands)
relatedRules: [rule1.mdc, rule2.mdc] (optional - other rules this interacts with)
relatedStandards: [standard1.md, standard2.md] (optional - standards this implements)
---
```

**MANDATORY: Include all required sections in content:**

```markdown

## How to Use This Rule

[Clear instructions for agents on how to apply this rule]

**This rule applies automatically when [condition]. Agents should [expected behavior].**
```

**Field-Specific Guidelines:**

1. **description** (REQUIRED):
   - One sentence max
   - Starts with a verb
   - Clearly states rule purpose
   - Examples:
     - ✅ Auto-applied rule for creating and modifying Cursor rules
     - ❌ This rule helps with rules (too vague)

2. **version** (REQUIRED):
   - Format: `X.Y.Z` (semantic versioning)
   - Start new rules at `1.0.0`
   - See `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc` for version increment rules

3. **lastUpdated** (REQUIRED):
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Use current date (run `date` command to verify)
   - Update EVERY time rule content changes

4. **globs** (OPTIONAL):
   - Omit if rule applies to all files
   - Use glob patterns to target specific files (NO quotes in .mdc files)
   - Examples:
     - `**/*.ts` - All TypeScript files
     - `**/*.{ts,tsx}` - TypeScript and TSX files
     - `{standards/**/*.md,docs/**/*.md}` - Multiple patterns

5. **alwaysApply** (REQUIRED):
   - `true`: Applies to all files/situations (most common)
   - `false`: Only applies to files matching `globs` pattern

6. **type** (REQUIRED):
   - Choose from 8 standard types (see `cursor-rules-standards.md` Section 4)
   - Format: `Type Name - Brief description` (NO quotes in .mdc files)
   - Examples:
     - `Auto-Applied Behavioral Rule - Guides AI agent behavior`
     - `Documentation Maintenance Rule - Tracks doc dependencies`

7. **relatedCommands** (OPTIONAL):
   - Array of command filenames (not full paths)
   - Examples: `[pre-flight-check.md, pr-review-check.md]`
   - List commands that:
     - Implement this rule
     - Are referenced by this rule
     - Complement this rule

8. **relatedRules** (OPTIONAL):
   - Array of rule filenames (not full paths)
   - Examples: `[environment.mdc, auto-heal.mdc]`
   - List rules that:
     - This rule depends on
     - Interact with this rule
     - Should be considered together

9. **relatedStandards** (OPTIONAL):
   - Array of standard paths (relative from `.cursor/rules/`)
   - Examples: `[process/linting.md, project-planning/documentation.md]`
   - List standards that:
     - This rule implements
     - Define requirements this rule enforces

### 3. After Creating/Modifying a Rule

**MANDATORY STEPS:**

#### Step 3.1: Validate Rule Structure

Run through this checklist:
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid and complete
- [ ] All required fields are present (description, version, lastUpdated, alwaysApply, type)
- [ ] Version follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- [ ] Type is declared and matches one of the 8 standard types
- [ ] Related commands/rules/standards are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] "When This Rule Applies" section is clear
- [ ] "Core Principle" section explains purpose
- [ ] "Agent Responsibilities" section has concrete guidance
- [ ] Examples are provided (Good vs Bad)
- [ ] "Related Files" section lists dependencies with descriptions
- [ ] "How to Use This Rule" section provides clear instructions

#### Step 3.2: Update Dependencies

**If you modified relatedCommands, relatedRules, or relatedStandards:**
1. Read each referenced file
2. Check if they should reference this rule back (bidirectional)
3. Update their metadata if needed

**Example:** If your rule references `pre-flight-check.md`, check if that command should list your rule in its "Related Rules" section.

#### Step 3.3: Update Related Documentation

**Always update:**
1. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Add entry with timestamp
   ```markdown
   ### 2025-12-04 15:30:00 - Added
   - **Cursor Rule:** `.cursor/rules/new-rule.mdc` (v1.0.0) - Brief description of purpose
   ```

**Update if applicable:**
2. **`AGENTS.md`** - If rule affects workflow
   - Section 3: Active Context (if currently working on rules)
   - Section 5: Persistent Memory (if important learning)
   - Section 8.2: Rules (Auto-Applied) list

3. **Integration Guides** - If rule should be copied to other projects
   - Update `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` to mention rule
   - Update `QUICK_INTEGRATION.md` copy commands

#### Step 3.4: Test the Rule

**Validation steps:**
1. **YAML Validation:** Ensure frontmatter parses correctly
2. **Markdown Validation:** Check all links work
3. **Logic Validation:** Does the rule trigger as expected?
4. **Conflict Check:** Does it conflict with other rules?

## Version Management

### When to Increment Version

**Major version (X.0.0):**
- Breaking changes in rule behavior
- Major restructuring
- Changed from conditional to always-apply (or vice versa)
- Removed or significantly changed agent responsibilities

**Minor version (X.Y.0):**
- New sections added
- New agent responsibilities
- New related files added
- Significant clarifications or expansions

**Patch version (X.Y.Z):**
- Typo fixes
- Clarifications without behavior change
- Formatting improvements
- Fixed broken links

**Always update both:**
- `version:` field in YAML frontmatter
- `lastUpdated:` field in YAML frontmatter

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Behavioral Rule

**Good:**
```yaml
---
description: Auto-applied rule for ensuring proper error handling in API routes
version: 1.0.0
lastUpdated: 2025-12-04
globs: **/{app,pages}/api/**/*.{ts,js}
alwaysApply: false
type: Auto-Applied Behavioral Rule - Ensures API error handling
relatedCommands: []
relatedRules: [auto-heal.mdc]
relatedStandards: [architecture/backend-module-plan.md]
---

# API Error Handling Rule

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying API route handlers in:
- `app/api/**/*.ts` (Next.js App Router)
- `pages/api/**/*.js` (Next.js Pages Router)

[Rest of content with clear examples...]
```

**Bad:**
```yaml
---
description: Error handling
version: 1
lastUpdated: 12/04/2025
type: API Rule
---

# Error Handling

Handle errors in API routes.
```
❌ Problems:
- Description too vague
- Version not semantic (should be 1.0.0)
- Date format wrong (should be YYYY-MM-DD)
- Missing required fields (alwaysApply, globs for conditional rules)
- Type doesn't match standard types (should be one of 8 types)
- Missing relatedCommands, relatedRules, relatedStandards
- Content structure incomplete (no examples, no "How to Use" section)

### Example 2: Modifying an Existing Rule

**Scenario:** Adding new section to `linting.mdc`

**Before:**
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
lastUpdated: 2025-12-02
```

**After:**
```yaml
version: 1.1.0  # ← Incremented minor version (new section)
lastUpdated: 2025-12-04  # ← Updated date
```

**Also updated:**
- Added new section: "## 7. TypeScript-Specific Linting"
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with entry
- Verified related commands still accurate

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Incomplete YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
description: Some rule
version: 1.0.0
---
```
**Fix:** Include ALL required fields (lastUpdated, alwaysApply, type)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Version Format
```yaml
version: 1  # ← Wrong
version: 1.0  # ← Wrong
```
**Fix:** Always use semantic versioning: `1.0.0`

### ❌ Mistake 3: Vague Type
```yaml
type: Rule for documentation  # ← Too vague
```
**Fix:** Use one of the 8 standard types from `cursor-rules-standards.md` (NO quotes in .mdc files)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Missing "How to Use" Section
**Fix:** Always include clear usage instructions at the end

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Updating lastUpdated
```yaml
lastUpdated: 2025-12-01  # ← Stale! Rule was just modified today
```
**Fix:** Always update when modifying content (use `date` command)

### ❌ Mistake 6: Listing Full Paths in Related Files
```yaml
relatedCommands: [../../.cursor/commands/pre-flight-check.md]  # ← Wrong
```
**Fix:** Use filename only: `[pre-flight-check.md]`

### ❌ Mistake 7: No Examples
**Fix:** Always provide "Good" vs "Bad" examples

---

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:

### `.cursor/rules/documentation-dependency-tracking.mdc`
- That rule tracks dependencies when ANY documentation is modified
- This rule focuses specifically on Cursor rules (`.mdc` files)
- Both rules ensure metadata is complete

### `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc`
- Defines version numbering standards
- Referenced for version increment rules

### `.cursor/commands/audit-documentation-metadata.md`
- Periodic audit command
- Validates rule metadata completeness

### `standards/process/cursor-rules-standards.md`
- Governing standard for rule creation
- This rule implements that standard's requirements

## How to Use This Rule

**This rule applies automatically when creating or modifying Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files).**

**Agents should:**
1. Verify complete YAML frontmatter with all required fields before creating rule
2. Use standard rule structure from `cursor-rules-standards.md`
3. Declare rule type from the 8 standard types
4. Include "How to Use This Rule" section with clear instructions
5. Update version and lastUpdated when modifying existing rules
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` after creating/modifying rules
7. Follow `documentation-dependency-tracking.mdc` for dependency management

**Validation checklist after creating/modifying:**
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete and valid
- [ ] Version incremented (if modification)
- [ ] lastUpdated updated
- [ ] Type declared (one of 8 standard types)
- [ ] Related files listed
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] "How to Use" section present
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated
- [ ] Dependencies verified

## Notes

- **Be thorough:** Rule quality directly impacts AI agent behavior
- **Provide examples:** Agents need concrete guidance
- **Test before publishing:** Verify rule doesn't conflict with others
- **Keep focused:** Each rule should have a single, clear purpose
- **Document integrations:** Explain how rule works with other rules/commands
