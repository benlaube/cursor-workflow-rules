# integrate-cursor-workflow-standards

I want to integrate the workflow rules from https://github.com/benlaube/cursor-workflow-rules

Follow the instructions in INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md:
1. Copy .cursor/rules/, .cursor/commands/, checklists/, and AGENTS.md
2. Adapt them for this project's stack
3. Verify everything is working
