# audit-project-commands-and-rules

When updating any file in .cursor/commands/ or .cursor/rules, ensure the meta data includes a version number that is updated on every change and a timestamp of the most recent change.  Ask the user what the rule should be applied to if it's a project rule.  Output should be an audit review file saved to /docs/audit.
