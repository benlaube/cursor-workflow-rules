# Task Workflow Rule

## 1. Before Starting a Task (Pre-Flight)

Before writing code, the agent MUST:
1.  **Check Structure:** specific to the project (see `standards/project-structure.md`).
2.  **Run Pre-Flight:** Read and follow `checklists/pre-flight-check.md`.
3.  **Verify Environment:** Ensure the app is launchable via `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc`.

## 2. During Development

1.  **Atomic Changes:** Make small, testable changes.
2.  **Self-Correction:** If a command fails, attempt to self-heal (see `self_healing.mdc`) before asking the user.
3.  **Tool Usage:** Use specialized tools (`read_file`, `grep`) over generic terminal commands.

## 3. After Completing a Task (Post-Flight)

Before confirming completion:
1.  **Run Review:** Read and follow `checklists/pr-review-check.md`.
2.  **Update Docs:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` and relevant `standards/` if architecture changed.
3.  **Verify Launch:** Run `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc` one last time to ensure no regression.
4.  **Launch Dev Server:** After completing a task or integration, launch the development server using `.cursor/commands/launch.mdc` so the user can see changes and test them. This should be done automatically unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

## 4. Documentation & Versioning

- **Docs:** Always update `CHANGELOG.md` with a timestamp and summary.
- **Versioning:** If editing a standard or documentation file, increment the `Version: X.X` metadata at the top of the file.
- **New Features:** If you added a new feature, ensure it is documented in `standards/` or `docs/`.
